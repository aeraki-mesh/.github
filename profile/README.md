## Manage any layer-7 protocols in a service mesh

### What does Aeraki stand for ? ##
Aeraki [Air-rah-ki] is the Greek word for 'breeze'. We hope this breeze can help Kubernets and Istio sail further in the cloud native adventure. 

### Why Aeraki Mesh ? ###
While service mesh becomes an important infrastructure for microservices, many(if not all) service mesh implementations mainly focus on HTTP protocols and treat other protocols as plain TCP traffic. Aeraki Mesh has been created to provide a non-intrusive, highly extendable way to manage any layer-7 traffic in an Istio service mesh, including Dubbo, Thrift, Redis, etc., and private protocols as well.
